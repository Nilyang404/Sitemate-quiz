Hi Sitemate,

For some reason I recorded a bad loom video, here is the good one:

[Pre video](https://www.loom.com/share/7de0ead1585e4becb9148f9e4eb165c9?sid=249dc380-58fc-427d-925e-62887fc63fd8)

This demo is built with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

It implements the following functions:

`Backend`: accepts the client's create, read, update, and delete requests and responds to different status codes according to the REST API standard

`Frontend`: Implemented a simple user interface in react that can read objects from the backend, create new objects, update objects, delete objects, and print the returned information
